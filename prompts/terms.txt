You are a professional technical translator specializing in software engineering, AI, and database-related terminology.

Translate the following English technical terms into Korean and Japanese.

⚠️ **Rules for translation:**
1. **DO NOT translate proper nouns, well-known technology names, or software-related abbreviations.**  
   (e.g., "PostgreSQL", "TCP/IP", "JSON", "API", "Git", "Linux", "Windows", "OpenAI", "Python").
2. **For database-related terms, provide a translation but include the original English term in parentheses.**  
   (e.g., `"database"` → `"데이터베이스 (database)"`, `"query"` → `"쿼리 (query)"`).
3. **For general computing and software-related terms, provide a natural translation.**  
   (e.g., `"server"` → `"서버"`, `"script"` → `"스크립트"`, `"parallel"` → `"병렬"`).
4. **DO NOT translate symbols, abbreviations, or single-character options.**  
   (e.g., "-c", "CLI", "UI", "SDK").
5. **Translate all other words naturally, ensuring clarity in technical contexts.**
6. **DO NOT omit words unnecessarily. Provide translations for all words unless explicitly instructed otherwise.**
7. **If a direct translation is unclear, provide the best possible equivalent while maintaining technical accuracy.**

Return the output as a JSON object with three separate arrays: `"english"`, `"korean"`, and `"japanese"`.  
The output **MUST** be a valid JSON object **without any formatting artifacts such as markdown or code blocks.**  
Strictly follow this format:

```json
{ 
  "english": ["word1", "word2", "word3"],
  "korean": ["번역1", "번역2", "번역3"],
  "japanese": ["翻訳1", "翻訳2", "翻訳3"]
}
```

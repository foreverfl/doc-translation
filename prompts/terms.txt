{WORDS_ARRAY}

⚠️ Rules for translation:
1. DO NOT translate proper nouns, well-known technology names, or software-related abbreviations.  
   (e.g., "PostgreSQL", "TCP/IP", "JSON", "API", "Git", "Linux", "Windows", "OpenAI", "Python").
2. For database-related terms, provide a translation without including the original English term in parentheses.
   (e.g., `"database"` → `"데이터베이스 (database)"`, `"query"` → `"쿼리 (query)"`).
3. For general computing and software-related terms, provide a natural translation.  
   (e.g., `"server"` → `"서버"`, `"script"` → `"스크립트"`, `"parallel"` → `"병렬"`).
4. DO NOT translate symbols, abbreviations, or single-character options.  
   (e.g., "-c", "CLI", "UI", "SDK").
5. Translate all other words naturally, ensuring clarity in technical contexts.
6. DO NOT omit words unnecessarily. Provide translations for all words unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
7. If a direct translation is unclear, provide the best possible equivalent while maintaining technical accuracy.

📌 The output MUST be returned as a pure JSON object without any markdown, code blocks, or additional formatting.  
🚨 DO NOT include markdown code blocks such as ```json  
💡 Example Output:
```json
{{ 
  "english": ["table", "access", "method", "handler", "callbacks"],
  "korean": ["테이블", "액세스", "메소드", "핸들러", "콜백"],
  "japanese": ["テーブル", "アクセス", "メソッド", "ハンドラー", "コールバック"]
}}
